# Water-Footprint-Tracker
The idea behide Water-Footprint-Tracker is to promote Sustainable Development Goal 6.
This app will allow users to monitor their water usage on a daily basis and provide tips on how to reduce their water consumption.

Here's how the app could work:

Upon downloading the app, users will be asked to input basic information such as their location, 
household size, and water usage habits (e.g. do they take long showers or run the tap while brushing their teeth) etc.

The app will use this information to calculate the user's daily water usage and provide 
personalized recommendations on how to reduce their water footprint using Machine Learning. 
These recommendations could include things like taking shorter showers, fixing leaky faucets, or using a low-flow toilet.

The app could also include educational resources on the importance of clean water and sanitation, 
as well as ways that users can get involved in local and global efforts to promote SDG 6.

As users make changes to their water usage habits, they could track their progress within the app 
and see how much water they've saved over time.

To further incentivize users to reduce their water footprint, the app could also include a
leaderboard or other social features that allow users to compete with friends and family members 
to see who can save the most water.

Overall, a Water Footprint Tracker app will be a practical and engaging way to promote SDG 6 and 
encourage individuals to take action towards a more sustainable future.
